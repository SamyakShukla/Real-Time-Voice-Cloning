# Real-Time Voice Cloning
This project is implemented by team AI Errors which consists of Samyak Shukla(E20CSE023), Siddharth Mathur(E20CSE080) and Mayank Shekhar(E20CSE182).
We are making our project on Deep fake voice cloning where we will be implementing Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time.
SV2TTS is a three-stage deep learning framework that allows to create a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio, and to use it to condition a text-to-speech model trained to generalize to new voices.
This SV2TTS model can power Hundred's of applications involving traditional TTS, including chat-bots and virtual assistants like Siri and Cortana. It can also give people a medium through which they can also voice themselves virtually.
